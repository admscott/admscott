## About Me
 
I'm an experienced Full Stack PHP Developer with skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm good at using PHP with frameworks like Laravel, and I know my way around modern front-end tools like React and Vue.js. Handling databases, especially MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, is something I'm comfortable with. I'm also skilled in integrating APIs and using Git for version control. I have experience in DevOps practices, like Docker for containers and Kubernetes for orchestration.

Throughout my career, I've successfully contributed to different projects, focusing on delivering high-quality solutions through effective problem-solving and collaboration in Agile environments.
